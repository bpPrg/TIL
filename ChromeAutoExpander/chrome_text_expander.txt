Topic: Using Text expansion in Chrome
======================================

While using overleaf in Google Chrome, I wanted to use the snippets like
as in Atom editor. 

I searched for paid mac applications:
a) aText $3
b) TextExpander $45 and so on.

NOTE: Default mac setting expansion does not work in overleaf, but works in mail.

Alternatives:
-------------
a) Chrome Plugin: Auto Text Expander
- can store upto 512 snippets as per chrome sync rule.
- Can use macros like d(MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a)  and %clip% 
- can use  102400 bytes (O.1 Mb) only.
- This is about one page of document.
- Works in overleaf.
- DOES NOT work In Google Doc.

b) Chrome Plugin: Blaze
- 3 groups and 10 snippets per group and 2500 characters per snippets.
- works in overleaf.
- Works In google doc.
- Pro version available $2 per month.




c) Chrome Plugin: ProKeys
 - DOES NOT work in overleaf
 - works in gmail (we can set alt space as the hot keys)
 - can save data locally 5 Mb.


NOTE: BLAZE sample
This is to confirm you checked out books today, {time: MMMM Do, YYYY}.
They will be due in 30 days ({time: MMMM Do, YYYY; shift=30D}).
If they are not returned in 45 days ({time: MMMM Do, YYYY; shift=45D}), your account will be frozen.
